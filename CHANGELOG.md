## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Function to calculate value of `TrigonometricRatio`s.

## [5.0.0] 2022-04-27

### Breaking

- Change `sum()` (a function) into `sum` (a computed property) and update their implementation.

### Added

- Provide conversion to binary numbers via arrays of 1s and 0s.
- Sums of windows in collections.
- Calculation of power sets of collection elements.
- Protocols for Graph, Edge and Node. Implementations for edges and nodes, and an adjacency matrix based graph.
- `Line2D` and `LineSegment2D` structs with functions for calculating intersection, perpendicular bisectors and midpoints, as well as solving for y given an x value.

## [4.1.0] 2021-12-06

### Added

- Median calculations.
- Conversion strings describing binary numbers to their integer value.
- Compute the power set of a collection.

### Fixes

- Base case for exponentiation, where N^0=1. Fix its precedence and visibility.
- Update some Gemfile depdencies.

## [4.0.0] 2020-03-08

### Changed

- Update iOS `deployment_target` version to 12.0.

### Fixed

- Update `PippinLibrary` dependency version.

## [3.0.1] 2020-03-08

### Fixed

- Update `PippinLibrary` dependency.

## [3.0.0] 2019-12-12

### Changed

- Update to Swift 5.

## [2.3.0] 2019-01-29

### Added

- Support for macOS starting with 10.12.

## [2.2.1] 2019-01-18

### Fixed

- Histograms only key by the upper bound of each bucket, whereas previously it used the full string description (e.g. `10` versus `1..<10`).

## [2.2.0] 2019-01-09

### Added

- Functions that given collections of integer or floating point values calculate mean, variance, standard deviation and histogram, a z-score for each value, and a convenience function to return the histogram of a data set's z-scores as a normalized distribution.

## [2.1.0] 2018-09-23

### Added

- Add function to `LocationGraphNode` to assign a "color" to each leaf node (in the form of an `Int` value) such that the resulting triangulation is 4-colored: no two triangles adjacent on a common edge have the same color.
- New unit tests for delaunay triangulation.

### Fixed

- Various debugging improvements for Delaunay triangulation, like how edges and triangles created due to edge flips are named, and test Swift generation for Triangles.

## [2.0.0] 2018-09-12

### Changed

- Removed function to sort a `Set<Vertex>` into counterclockwise order.
- Converted IUO properties to nonoptional properties appropriately set before on init. `Edge.a`/`.b`, `Triangle.a`/`.b`/`.c` and `Vertex.x`/`.y`.
- Renamed a function to correctly capitalize a word: `assignNewtriangleNeighbors` becomes `assignNewTriangleNeighbors`.
- `LocationGraphNode.getTriangles()` is no longer optional. It will just return an empty set if no leaf nodes are found.

### Added

- `Edge`, `Triangle` and `Vertex` may now optionally have a name specified, or have one generated automatically on init. Helps read logs.
- Show recursion depth in logs from recursive functions.
- Bunches of comments and diagrams documenting innards of `DelaunayTriangulator`.
- Add a function to `Triangle` to output Swift code to reconstruct it, for e.g. unit tests.
- Add functions for `Set<Triangle>` to return `Set<Vertex>` and a `String` description of a sorted list of brief descriptions of all contained `Triangle`s.
- Typealiases for `Degree` and `Radian`.
- `enum`s:
	- `TrigonometricRatio` defining `cos`, `sin` etc and some helper functions.
	- `Quadrant` defining the four parts of the Cartesian plane and some query functions.
- `struct`s:
	 - `PolarCoordinate2D`.
	 - `CartesianCoordinate2D`.
	 - `Angle` (with an `AngleOrientation` `enum` that needs to be reconciled with `PlanarOrientation`).
 - A function to compute distance between two `CGPoints`.


### Fixed

- In `DelaunayTriangulator`:
	- After an edge flip, not all of the necessary edges of the new pair of neighboring triangles received propagated legality testing. For two `Triangle`s adjacent on a common `Edge`, the remaining four `Edges` between them are now used to propagate edge legalization.
	- During edge legality testing, an `Edge` and another `Vertex` are used to construct a `Triangle` whose circumscribed circle is queried to contain another `Vertex` (call it `x` here). Previously, the endpoints of the `Edge` were treated specially for ghost points, and if none were there, execution proceeded directly to the incircle test. If `x` is a ghost point, the calculation is nonsensical. Inserted a new check to see if `x` is a ghost point before proceeding to the actual incircle test.
- Querying `LocationGraphNode` for all leaf `Triangle` instances would leave all its nodes' `visited` property set to `true`, so subsequent queries would return the empty set. Reset all nodes' `visited` property to `false` before returning the results of the query in `getTriangles()`.
- Comparisons of `Triangle` now consider equality between sets of its `Vertex` instances, instead of sets of its `Edge`s.
